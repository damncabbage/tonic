# Tonic

Play notes on an instrument and have Tonic use your microphone to tell you what other notes will sound good.

Tonic uses the [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html) to figure out what notes you're playing, matches up these notes with scales they fall on, and displays other notes from the scales. This is intended as a visual aid to help to get more of an intuitive feel for scales.
